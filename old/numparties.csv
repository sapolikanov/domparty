Malawi,87,2014,553,2,"The primaries system in Malawi is said to be quite chaotic and can often result in losing candidates running as independents, which accounts for their high size in the National Assembly. Researchers have shown, that these independents tend to join a strong presedential party in their voting. Considering that the presidential election was annuled this year, and after a fresh one, a candidate from a second largest party took the seat, we expect indendents to join either DPP or MCP, thus counting two relevant parties."
