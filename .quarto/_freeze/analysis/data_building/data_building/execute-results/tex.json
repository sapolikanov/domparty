The original paper collapsed these categories into a single one, but the experience of \"trading hands\" of different powers is likely to be extremely different from not being colonized at all. I will keep the variable as is, but I will also provide a sensitivity analysis where I collapse the categories into a single one. The latter option allows us to zero in on the differences between the British and the French, which is of course the motivating factor between the variable.\n\nParty system institutionalization data comes from V-Dem v10 (march 2020) \\parencite{coppedge_v-dem_2020}. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npsi <- vdem |> \n  select(country_name, ccodecow = COWcode, year, v2xps_party) |> \n  mutate(v2xps_party_mean = if_else(is.na(v2xps_party)\n                                    & str_c(ccodecow, year, sep = \"_\") %in% cy,\n                                    round(mean(v2xps_party[year >= 2013\n                                                           & year <= 2018], \n                                         na.rm = T), 3), v2xps_party),\n         v2xos_party_next = if_else(is.na(v2xps_party)\n                                    & str_c(ccodecow, year, sep = \"_\") %in% cy,\n                                    lead(v2xps_party, 1), v2xps_party)) |> \n  filter(str_c(ccodecow, year, sep = \"_\") %in% cy)\n\nggplot(psi, aes(x = v2xps_party_mean)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_dotplot(fill = \"grey60\", binwidth = 0.03) +\n  labs(title = \n         \"Party System Institutionalization in Sub-Saharan African Countries\",\n       caption = \"\\nsource: V-Dem v10 (march 2020), Coppedge et al.
