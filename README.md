The project aims to be fully replicatable, public and serves as an item in my portfolio. I am using a [reproducible research workflow from Aaron Gullickson](https://github.com/AaronGullickson/research-template).

The project attempts to find factors, influencing party dominance in the sub-Saharan Africa region. The key contribution to existing studies is the deliniation between democratic and autocratic party dominance, defined analytically. 

There was no initial data building file when I started working on revitalizing this, only a dataset I have assembled by hand (not very reproducible is it) and with lost script files, I assume. Based on the good enough description of the process, given in the text resulting from this project, I redo the databuilding.
