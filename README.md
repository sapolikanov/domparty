The project aims to be fully reproducible, public and serves as an item in my portfolio. I am using a [reproducible research workflow from Aaron Gullickson](https://github.com/AaronGullickson/research-template).

The project attempts to find factors, influencing party dominance in the sub-Saharan Africa region. The key contribution to existing studies is the deliniation between democratic and autocratic party dominance, defined analytically. The original paper, which is a coursework from 2021 is in the main/ directory. It has not been modified or updated. It is not a representative writing sample due to its age, but is there to familiarize with the research design. 

There was no initial data building file when I started working on revitalizing this, only a dataset I have assembled by hand (not very reproducible is it) and with lost script files, I assume. Based on the good enough description of the process, given in the text resulting from this project, I redo the databuilding. 

The deliverables of this project are two files: data_building.qmd and models.qmd, describing step-by-step data building and modelling, respectively.

I may update this project with an extended data analysis in the future, but since there is no immediate scientific value in this, it is not high on priority list. Even if the analysis would be redone in a different logic (panel data or a different research design), there is very limited contribution in my eyes.
